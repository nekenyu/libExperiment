# Update doc/ directory in this branch from .gitignored documentation built on
# master (or any branch) that is .gitignored.
#
# The trick is that the .gitignored built document remains when changing
# branches, leaving it for rsync to copy it into place and git add -u to update
# git automatically for that directory.
#
# If you must have files which are committed on both branches, then you can do
# a two-step solution: Use a similar script in the source branch to copy to a
# .gitignored temporary location, then use this script to finish.
#
# Note: If you run this without build documentation, you will update to no
# documentation.  You can fix this by rebuilding the documentation and and
# re-running the update script.


# Setup
# 1) In branch you want to build documentation in (i.e. master):
#   a) build directory configured in SRC variable in this script (below)
#   b) ensure directory is in .gitignore in that branch
#
# 2) In branch you want documentation in (i.e. gh-pages):
#  a) add this script
#  b) configure SRC and DEST variables (below)
#
# Usage:
# 1) In branch you want to build documentation in (i.e. master):
#  a) build documentation
#  b) commit your work (not including the documentation)
# 
# 2) Switch branches to the branch you want documentation in (i.e. gh-pages):
#  a) git checkout <branch>
#
# 3) In branch you want documentation in (i.e. gh-pages):
#  a) run this script (i.e. ./update-doc.sh)
#  b) git commit


# Directory to copy from
# 
# Should be .gitignored in the branch it is built in
#
# NOTE: have trailing/ if you want directory _contents_ pushed
SRC=doc_built/html/


# Destination directory
#
# Directory in current branch to copy to
#
# Note: Trailing / required
DEST=doc/

# Update the directory
#

echo Updating ${DEST} from ${SRC}:

rsync -rlptzq --delete ${SRC} ${DEST}
# rsync: Do this right or everything is wrong:
# Last line <dir-to-send>/ <parent-to-hold-dir-to-send>/ # Trailing / are REQUIRED


# Update git
#
#
echo Updating ${DEST} with 'git add -A':

git add -A doc/
